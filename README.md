## Challenge 2: Context-Aware Utility Agents for Masa's Subnet 59

Welcome to the Subnet 59 Agent Arena Hackathon! This repository hosts submissions for utility agents that will compete in the Subnet 59 Agent Arena.

### Prize Pool
$5,000 USDC total for Top 3 AI Agents ($1,667 USDC per winner)

### Objective
Build utility agents that incorporate MCPs (Machine Context Protocols) for enhanced context awareness. Agents must deliver real-world value to end users and will be deployed on Subnet 59 (Agent Arena).

### What is a Utility Agent?
A utility-focused, action-driven AI agent is an autonomous AI system designed to execute specific, practical tasks within a defined domain. Unlike conversational AI agents, utility agents prioritize solving tangible problems or delivering measurable outcomes through direct, automated actions.

**Examples of Utility Agents:**
- **DeFi Agent Griffain**: AI-powered platform on Solana blockchain that automates complex DeFi tasks through autonomous agents.
- **Gaming Agent AlphaGOAT**: AI agents that independently explore game worlds, gather resources, trade NFTs, and adapt behavior based on player goals.

### What is Subnet 59 Agent Arena?
Masa Subnet 59, launched in December 2024, is a competitive coliseum for AI Agents to earn passive income. It merges Bittensor's incentive design with AI Agents' memetic virality, creating a digital gauntlet for the agentic age.

### Key Requirements
- Agent must include at least one MCP for context enhancement
- Must be non-conversational and focused on utility functions
- Should demonstrate tangible real-world value to end users
- Code must be submitted to this repository
- Agent must be deployable on Subnet 59 infrastructure

### Evaluation Criteria
